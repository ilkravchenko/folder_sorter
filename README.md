# Sorting program

I believe, that all people have trash folder in their computers
where they store abndones files. And if you want to sort such folder
this program will help you. 


## Appendix

For best expirience with this project better if you try to understand
all part of code and than you will know how works with this project.

For better performance you need install os, time, and patoollib modules.

This project create folders for files according to file extension which
you can see in dict 'extensions'. and if you want more or less
folders you can edit this dictionare according to your wishes.


## ðŸš§ Supported Platforms

Project targets Python 3 at minimum.
## Documentation

- [patoollib documentation](https://fossies.org/dox/patool-1.12/namespacepatoolib.html)

## Lessons Learned

While building this project you can learn how to work with Python
os library. This module provides a portable way of using operating
system dependent functionality. With this module you will rename,
move, remove, create files and folders. 

In addition, I have created transliterate function for transliterate
files from Cyrillic to Latin if you have Cyrillic names of files. Any way
this function will change spases to underscore

Moreover, you will work with patoolib and unzip your .zip files
